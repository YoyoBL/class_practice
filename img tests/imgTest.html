         <summary>Michael Jordan</summary>
         <p>
            Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his
            initials MJ,[9] is an American businessman and former professional
            basketball player. His biography on the official NBA website states:
            "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of
            all time."[10] He played fifteen seasons in the National Basketball
            Association (NBA), winning six NBA championships with the Chicago
            Bulls. Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte
            Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He
            was integral in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s
            and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon in the process.[12]
            Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean
            Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a
            member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5]
            Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft
            pick,[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining
            crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one
            of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability,
            demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in
            Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His
            Airness".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in
            1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993,
            securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball
            before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but
            returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more
            championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72
            regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the
            second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons
            from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13]
            During the course of his professional career he was also selected to
            play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals
            (at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992
            Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics), while also
            being undefeated.[15] Jordan's individual accolades and
            accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP)
            awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP
            awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive
            First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA
            All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA
            Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for
            career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and
            career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he
            was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by
            ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of
            athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the
            Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his
            individual career,[16] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United
            States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team").[17] He
            became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in
            2009,[18] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in
            2010,[19] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015
            and a "Dream Team" member in 2017.[20][21] In 2021, Jordan was named
            to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[22] One of the most effectively
            marketed athletes of his generation,[11] Jordan is known for his
            product endorsements.[23] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan
            sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular
            today.[24] Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 live-action
            animation hybrid film Space Jam and is the central focus of the Emmy
            Award-winning documentary miniseries The Last Dance (2020).[25] He
            became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the
            Charlotte Bobcats (now named the Hornets) in 2006,[24] and bought a
            controlling interest in 2010. In 2016, Jordan became the first
            billionaire player in NBA history.[26] In 2016, President Barack
            Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2022,
            Jordan's net worth is estimated at $1.7 billion.[28]

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>
         Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New
         York City, on February 17, 1963,[29] the son of bank employee Deloris
         (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] In
         1968, he moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[31]
         Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he
         highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and
         football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his
         sophomore year; at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short
         to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the
         only sophomore to make the team.[32][33] Motivated to prove his worth,
         Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team, and tallied some
         40-point games.[32] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm)
         and trained rigorously.[33] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster,
         Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two
         seasons of high school play.[34] As a senior, he was selected to play
         in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[35][36]
         after averaging 27 ppg,[34] 12 rebounds (rpg),[37][38] and six assists
         per game (apg) for the season.[38][39][40] Jordan was recruited by
         numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina,
         South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[41] In 1981, he accepted a
         basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel
         Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[42]
