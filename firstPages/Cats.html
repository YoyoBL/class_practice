      <p>
         The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
         mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
         and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
         distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are
         commonly kept as house pets, but can also be farm cats or feral cats;
         the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats
         are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
         rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
         registries.[6] The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid
         species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
         and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision
         and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes
         vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
         grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most
         active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but
         a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency
         for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7]
         Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.[8] Female domestic cats can
         have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often
         ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown
         at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.
         Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering,
         but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in
         large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction
         of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10] It was long thought
         that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were
         venerated from around 3100 BC,[11][12] but recent advances in
         archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred
         in Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13] As of 2021, there were an estimated
         220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As
         of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United
         States, with 95.6 million cats owned[16][17][18] and around 42 million
         households own at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of
         adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet
         cats as of 2020.[20]

      <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
      <p>
         The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
         the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of
         the 6th century.[21] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived
         from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine
         form suffixed with -t.[22] The Late Latin word may be derived from
         another Afro-Asiatic[23] or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word
         kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or
         cognates.[24] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~
         قِطّ qiṭṭ. However, it is "equally likely that the forms might derive
         from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek
         and to Syriac and Arabic".[25] The word may be derived from Germanic
         and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from
         Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy,
         "lady, female stoat"; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred
         animal)".[26] The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is
         attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch
         poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or
         Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and
         Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it
         may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[27][28] A male cat
         is called a tom or tomcat[29] (or a gib,[30] if neutered). An unspayed
         female is called a queen,[31] (or a molly,[32] if spayed), especially
         in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten.
         In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the
         now-obsolete word catling.[33] A group of cats can be referred to as a
         clowder or a glaring.[34]
